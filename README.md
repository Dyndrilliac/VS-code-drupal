# Drupal Syntax Highlighting

This VS Code extension does one and only one thing: it provides syntax highlighting support for Drupal specific file types, such as .module, .inc, .theme etc.

# "This module is useless because you can specify the filetypes in settings.json" 

Specifying the filetypes in settings.json is useless, because of this module :-p
Besides, did you remember to include in your settings.json the less common Drupal extensions, such as .make and/or .profile? No? That's where you want to download this module ;-)

1. Open the Command Palette in VS Code (Ctrl-Shift-P, Mac: Cmd-Shift-P)
